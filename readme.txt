== Description ==

This plugin lets you customize the Youtube videos you are going to embed in your posts and pages. In the plugin option page you'll be able to see a preview of your customized video and you'll get the new embed code which you have to copy and paste in the Wordpress text editor (Text/HTML mode). The plugin doesn't work with the old embed code. Have fun!
